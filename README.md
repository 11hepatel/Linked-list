# Linked list /// std::list

---

## What is this repository?
The files listed here are the starting point for your assignment.
Only add source files (not compiled files) to the Git repository.

## Description
Mimic the std::list behavior with your MyList.
You must use a doubly linked list.
You must use exactly one sentinel node (or a dummy node, to which the m_sentinel pointer points), which is linked to the last and first elements of the list at all times.
This sentinel node means you should NOT have special cases for a list that contains zero data elements (see the slides for list initialization).
